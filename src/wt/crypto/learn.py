"""The learning job (DEC-0016, 2 to 4): once a day, in this order.

    python -m wt.crypto.learn            (the daily job `crypto-learn`)

  1. outcomes   every recorded signal is followed to its result with its sleeve's own exits and costs
  2. the tests  at a checkpoint (every 60 finished signals) the model in force is promoted, held or demoted;
                a drift in its inputs suspends it
  3. retrain    once a week the models are trained and compared again, in the machine-learning environment,
                by the method the charter fixes. A model that beats taking every signal is registered in
                shadow. If none does, there is no model in force and the desk says so.

This process is the trading side: it imports no machine-learning library. Training runs as a separate process
under a time limit, and its failure changes nothing on the desk. The owner's switch stops steps 2 and 3;
outcomes are still recorded, because they are a record and not an action.
