"""Whether the model in force may act (DEC-0016, 4): shadow, promotion at fixed checkpoints, demotion, drift.

A registered model scores every signal of the three registered sleeves before the signal's outcome exists. It
acts on nothing until it passes a test on those signals, and the test is only looked at after every 60 of them
have finished, at most 6 times for one lineage, with the significance level split across the looks.

    state       shadow     scores, acts on nothing
                acting     skips a signal scored below the cut-off, halves one scored just above it
                demoted    failed the rolling test while acting; acts on nothing again
                suspended  the market no longer looks like the training data; acts on nothing until retrained

The state is `var/crypto/models/promotion.json`; every change of it is a `model` row in the desk's journal.

Where the charter is silent this module reads it narrowly:
  * A "lineage" is a model kind with its settings (`m1:C=1`). Weekly retrainings of one lineage share its
    checkpoints: every signal counted was scored by a model trained before the signal existed. A retraining
    that chooses another kind or other settings starts a new lineage in shadow, with no checkpoints used.
  * "The plain win rate" a model's Brier score must beat is the win rate of the very signals it is tested on:
    the best a constant can do, so the harder of the two readings.
  * The stability index is measured over five equal parts of the training data. With 60 signals a finer cut
    would trip on noise alone.
  * A demoted lineage is not promoted again. The model does not apply to the baseline rule or to challengers:
    it was trained on the three registered rules and on nothing else.
