"""Deploy reviewed code into the live checkout, only when no trading job can be affected (ADR 0002).

    python -m wt.ops.deploy gate                          # print whether a deploy is allowed now, and why not
    python -m wt.ops.deploy deploy [--sha SHA] [--stage]  # one transaction: see below
    python -m wt.ops.deploy rollback <tag>                # back to a runtime-* tag (same gate, same checks)
    python -m wt.ops.deploy migrate                       # move runtime files out of tracked paths (same gate)

The gate refuses when any com.wt.* job is running or holds its lock, inside the trading night
(07:00 ET to close + 2 h on a session day), within an hour of a scheduled start, or when the market calendar
can't be read.

A deploy is one transaction on one exact commit (plan v7 B7):
  1. the target (--sha, default the tip of main) must be on main, a fast-forward of the live checkout, and green:
     every required GitHub check concluded "success" on that commit (wt.ops.ci);
  2. the live dashboard must not be older than the dashboard/contract code it brings (wt.ops.dashguard);
  3. --stage: the full test suite runs in a throwaway worktree of the target with its own locked venv, BEFORE the
     live checkout changes; a red suite changes nothing;
  4. under the deploy lock (jobs wait for it; wt.ops.jobs), with the gate checked again: tag, fast-forward to
     exactly the target (never a second fetch), migrate state, sync the venv, smoke test. A failed smoke test
     rolls back to the tag inside the same lock, without asking the gate again: restoring the code that was
     running is always allowed.
