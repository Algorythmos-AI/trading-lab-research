"""Hash-chained append-only ledgers: the forward ledger and the paper journal (plan R3).

Every chained line carries `prev_sha256` (expected_prev): once the chain has started, the sha256 of every line
since the previous chained line, that line included, joined by newlines exactly as written. In a fully chained
file that is simply the previous line. Before the chain starts (a legacy prefix) it is the previous line only, as
it always was, so existing ledgers keep verifying; a fresh file's first line carries GENESIS. A *break* is a
chained line whose prev_sha256 doesn't match: what an edit, a deletion or a reordering produces, and the only
thing verify_chain reports.

Lines without prev_sha256 (written by older code after a rollback) and torn lines (a writer killed mid-line) are
not breaks: the next chained line commits to them and to the chained line before them, so none of those lines can
be changed or dropped afterwards without a break (second review of plan R3). They are listed by notes(). Flagging them would turn entries
off for good over an event nobody can undo (review of plan R3). Like any hash chain, an edit to the very last line
is invisible here: that is what the daily off-host anchor of `head()` is for (wt.ops.backup).
